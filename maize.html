            <span>corn, (Zea mays), also called Indian corn or maize, cereal plant of the grass family (Poaceae) and its
                edible grain. The domesticated crop originated in the Americas and is one of the most widely distributed
                of the world’s food crops. Corn is used as livestock feed, as human food, as biofuel, and as raw
                material in industry.Corn was first domesticated by native peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years
                ago. Modern corn is believed to have been derived from the Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), a
                wild grass. Its culture had spread as far north as southern Maine by the time of European settlement of
                North America, and Native Americans taught European colonists to grow the indigenous grains. Since its
                introduction into Europe by Christopher Columbus and other explorers and colonizers, corn has spread to
                all areas of the world suitable to its cultivation.</span>

        <h1>ABOUT MAIZE</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Maize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability under varied
            agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic
            yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider
            diversity of soil, climate, biodiversity and management practices that contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the
            global grain production. The United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of maize contributes
            nearly 35 % of the total production in the world and maize is the driver of the US economy. The USA has the
            highest productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1 ) which is double than the global average (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the
            average productivity in India is 2.43 t ha-1In India, maize is the third most important food crops after
            rice and wheat. According to advance estimate its production is likely to be 22.23 M Tonnes (2012-13) mainly
            during Kharif season which covers 80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9 % in the national food
            basket. In addition to staple food for human being and quality feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw
            material as an ingredient to thousands of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic
            beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries
            etc.The maize is cultivated throughout the year in all states of the country for various purposes including
            grain, fodder, green cobs, sweet corn, baby corn, pop corn in peri-urban areas. The predominant maize
            growing states that contributes more than 80 % of the total maize production are Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %),
            Karnataka (16.5 %), Rajasthan (9.9 %), Maharashtra (9.1 %), Bihar (8.9 %), Uttar Pradesh (6.1 %), Madhya
            Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %). Apart from these states maize is also grown in Jammu and Kashmir
            and North-Eastern states. Hence, the maize has emerged as important crop in the non-traditional regions i.e.
            peninsular India as the state like Andhra Pradesh which ranks 5th in area (0.79 m ha) has recorded the
            highest production (4.14 m t) and productivity (5.26 t ha-1 ) in the country although the productivity in
            some of the districts of Andhra Pradesh is more or equal to the USA.Maize can be grown successfully in
            variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam. However, soils with good organic matter content
            having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity. Being a
            sensitive crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity stresses; it is desirable
            to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field having higher salinity. Therefore, the
            fields having provision of proper drainage should be selected for cultivation of maize.All India Coordinated
            Research Project (AICRP) on maize was launched in 1957 with the objective to develop and disseminate
            genetically superior cultivars and production/protection technologies. AICRP organizes interdisciplinary,
            interinstitutional, co-operative and systematic testing of newly developed cultivars of both public and
            private sectors for different agro-climatic zones of the country. The project resulted in refining efforts
            in varietal improvement. Since 1961, a total number of 187 cultivars including single cross hybrids,
            composites and multiple parent crosses have been released nationwide. In India, maize is traditionally grown
            in monsoon (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature </p>

        <h1> HISTORY</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Maize is a cultigen; human intervention is required for it to propagate. Whether or not the kernels fall off
            the cob on their own is a key piece of evidence used in archaeology to distinguish domesticated maize from
            its naturally-propagating teosinte ancestor.[4] Genetic evidence can also be used to determine when various
            lineages split.[12]

            Most historians believe maize was domesticated in the Tehuacán Valley of Mexico.[13] Recent research in the
            early 21st century has modified this view somewhat; scholars now indicate the adjacent Balsas River Valley
            of south-central Mexico as the center of domestication.[14]

            An 2002 study by Matsuoka et al.. has demonstrated that, rather than the multiple independent domestications
            model, all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. The study also
            demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands. Later, maize spread
            from this region over the Americas along two major paths. This is consistent with a model based on the
            archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the
            lowlands
        </p>


        <h1> CULTIVATION</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring. Its root system
            is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses C4 carbon fixation,
            maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use C3 carbon fixation such as alfalfa
            and soybeans. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready
            for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize was
            "knee-high by the Fourth of July", although modern hybrids generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for
            silage is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the "milk
            stage", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field
            maize is left in the field until very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact,
            sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is
            shown in many parts of Africa, where periodic drought regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent
            famine. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or
            wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop
        </p>


        <h1>FOOD AND NUTRITION</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Corn is the third largest plant-based food source in the world. Despite its importance as a major food in
            many parts of the world, corn is inferior to other cereals in nutritional value. Its protein is of poor
            quality, and it is deficient in niacin. Diets in which it predominates often result in pellagra
            (niacin-deficiency disease). Corn is high in dietary fibre and rich in antioxidants.

            Unlike many other cereal grains, corn flour is gluten-free and cannot be used alone to make rising breads.
            It is widely used, however, in Latin American cuisine to make masa, a kind of dough used in such staple
            foods as tortillas, arepas, and tamales. In the United States and many other places, sweet corn is boiled or
            roasted on the cob, creamed, converted into hominy (hulled kernels) or meal, and cooked in corn puddings,
            mush, polenta, griddle cakes, cornbread, and scrapple. It is also used for popcorn, confections, and various
            manufactured breakfast cereal preparations
            Corn oil, valued for its bland flavour and light colour, is used primarily for food. It is favoured as a
            salad oil and frying oil because it contains little cholesterol. Corn oil can be converted into margarine by
            hydrogenation, a process in which the oil is combined with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure in the
            presence of a catalyst.
            Corn is also fermented into a number of alcoholic beverages, notably bourbon and other corn whiskeys.



        <h1> SELECTION OF SEEDS</h1>
        <p id="first">
            The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield.
            Therefore,
            proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in raising
            the
            healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the
            following
            requirements
            The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.The seed should be clean
            and
            free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in
            size.The
            seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.The seed should have a high germinating
            capacity.Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against
            soil-born
            fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings
