            <h3>BREIFING</h3>
            <span>Jute is a long, soft, shiny bast fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced
                from flowering plants in the genus Corchorus, which is in the mallow family Tiliaceae. The primary
                source of the fiber is Corchorus olitorius, but such fiber is considered inferior to that derived from
                Corchorus capsularis. "Jute" is the name of the plant or fiber used to make burlap, hessian, or gunny
                cloth.

                Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers and second only to cotton in the amount produced and
                variety of uses. Jute fibers are composed primarily of plant materials cellulose and lignin. Jute fiber
                falls into the bast fiber category (fiber collected from bast, the phloem of the plant, sometimes called
                the "skin") along with kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), ramie, etc. The industrial term for jute
                fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown and 1–4 meters (3–13 feet) long. Jute is also
                called the "golden fiber" for its color and high cash value.

                The bulk of the jute trade is centered in South Asia, with India and Bangladesh as the primary
                producers. The majority of jute is used for sustainable packaging, for products like coffee bags.
                Production has declined in recent decades as plastic packaging dominated the market instead. This trend
                has recently begun to reverse, however, as numerous countries phase out or ban the use of single-use
                plastics</span>

        <h1>ABOUT JUTE</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Jute is an important natural fibre crop in India next to cotton. In trade and industry, jute and mesta crop
            together known as raw jute as their uses are almost same. Raw jute plays an important role in the country’s
            economy. Raw jute was originally considered as a source of raw material for packaging industries only. But
            it has now emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such as, textile industries, paper
            industries, building and automotive industries, use as soil saver, use as decorative and furnishing
            materials, etc. Raw jute being bio-degradable and annually renewable source, it is considered as an
            environment-friendly crop and it helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance. Further
            attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability, inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate.
            Moreover, it can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibres.Although Jute acreage has
            stabilized around 8 lakh hectares in the country, jute productivity has more than doubled to 22.12 q/ha in
            2010-11 since partition of the country from 11 qtl per ha and the total production of raw jute in the
            country is about 10.58 million bales of 180 kg each. This has happened due to development of short duration
            high yielding varieties as well as other production technologies by ICAR including fertilizer management,
            weed management, farm machineries and pest management. CRIJAF (ICAR) has developed around 15 high yielding
            varieties of jute and allied fibres. Production and distribution of certified seed of newly released
            varieties are the need of the hour for further improvement in productivity. ICAR has taken the initiatives
            for production of quality seed of newly released varieties of jute in its farms which may increase the yield
            by at least 20-30%. Five most important issues namely, improvement in productivity, quality improvement,
            retting of jute, farm machineries and quality seed production are addressed by the ICAR through various
            on-going projects, which have contributed to the present level of production with adequate support from the
            Jute Technology Mission and Directorate of Jute Development of the Ministry of Agriculture.With its
            insignificant coverage of total cultivated area, it plays a predominant role in the country’s economy by
            generating employment, earning foreign exchange, solving many of the socio-economic problems, etc. In
            earlier years, Jute was considered as a Golden Fibre but there after it had to pass through different
            critical situation. The main problem came in the way with the introduction of synthetic fibre by the end of
            sixties/early seventies. After the development of diversified product of jute fibre and due to growing
            concern about the environment pollution, the importance of jute has again revived.

        <h1> IMPORTANT REGIONS</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Jute cultivation is mainly concentrated in the eastern and north eastern India while that of mesta
            cultivation is spread almost throughout the country. The crop can be grown in low, medium and high land
            situation, both moisture stress and water stagnating condition. White Jute can be grown comparatively in low
            land situation while that of Tossa Jute prefers medium and high land situation. Mesta is grown in almost all
            over the country. It being a hardy crop and can tolerate moisture stress; its cultivation is spread in
            different agro-climatic situations unlike jute which is concentrated only in eastern and north eastern
            States. In a major part of Jute area, particularly in North Bengal, Bihar and North-Eastern States, the soil
            is acidic in nature. However, the Jute crop is growing in these areas in existing situation adjusting the
            crop sequence

        <h1> PESTS AND DISEASE</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Distribution: Corchorus olitorius and C. capsularis are the two species of Jute cultivated in Assam, West
            Bengal, Orissa, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh which are attacked by this pest. It is particularly serious on C.
            olitorius.Nature of damage: The adult beetle girdles the stem at two levels before it starts oviposition.
            This causes withering, drooping and death of the portion above the lower girdle to a length varying from 5 -
            50 cm thus resulting in loss of fibre yield.Management strategies
            Spray application of phosalone 0.07% or endosulfan 0.07 % at fortnightly interval.Removal and destruction of
            drooping stem portions and stem casings containing the larvae in diapause.Growing of C. capsularis jute
            which is not preferred by the insect.Jute weevil Apion corchori Mshll. (Apionidae: Coleoptera)Distribution:
            The insect occurs in a serious form on jute in Bihar and U.P.Nature of damage: The adult weevil excavates a
            small hole on the stem and oviposits. The grubs tunnel into the pith. Due to damage a gall-like swelling is
            formed. C. capsularis is more susceptible to attack than C. olitorius.Life history: The weevil is dull black
            or dark brown in colour and a female is capable of laying up to 675 eggs during an oviposition period of
            about 4 months. The egg, larval and pupal periods last for 3 – 5, 8 – 18 and 4 days respectively. Management
            strategies:Spray application of phosalone 0.07% or endosulfan 0.07 or cypermethrin 0.005%.Spodoptera exigua
            (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera)Distribution: Has worldwide distribution which includes Europe, South Africa,
            America and the oriental region. In India, it is quite widespread, found attacking jute, indigo, Lucerne,
            lentil, cabbage, maize, cotton and gram.Nature of damage: The caterpillars, on hatching, gather on the leaf
            surface, the epidermis of which they eat. At this young stage, they are also in the habit of webbing
            together either several leaflets or the margin of the same large leaf. At times, these webs give a shabby
            look to the crop. Within these webs the young larvae live gregariously only for two or three days and
            thereafter they separate and spread out.The feeding activity of grown up larva is generally confined to a
            few morning hours i.e. 9 to 11 a.m. and then again after 4 p.m. or so.
