            <span>Rice is a major food staple and a mainstay for the rural population and their food security. It is
                mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one hectare. Rice is also a wage commodity
                for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the
                population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the
                food security of over half the world population</span>

        <h1>ABOUT RICE</h1>
        <p id="first">
            About RiceOryza Sativa, it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate, though it is not a tropical
            plant. It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far
            Eastern Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern
            India, then spread to the north of the country and then onwards to China. It then arrived in Korea, the
            Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.).The journey of rice around
            the world has been slow, but once it took root it stayed and became a major agriculture and economic product
            for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of the cultivated land is given to rice
            (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts of India. In the
            northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is
            cooked daily as well as on festivals and special occasions.
        </p>

        <h1> HISTORY OF RICE IN INDIA</h1>
        <p id="first">
            History of Rice in IndiaIndia is an important centre of rice cultivation. The rice is cultivated on the
            largest areas in India. Historians believe that while the indica variety of rice was first domesticated in
            the area covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern India), stretching through
            Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Southern China, the japonica variety was domesticated from wild rice in
            southern China which was introduced to India. Perennial wild rice still grow in Assam and Nepal. It seems to
            have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains. It then
            spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers. Some says that the word rice is derived from
            the Tamil word arisi.
        </p>


        <h1> CLIMATIC REQUIRMENTS</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Climatic RequirementsIn India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice
            cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ยบN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop
            needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and
            an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges
            from 21 to 37ยบ C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C..
        </p>


        <h1>NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF RICE</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Rice is a nutritional staple food which provides instant energy as its most important component is
            carbohydrate (starch). On the other hand, rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average composition of
            these substances being only 8 per cent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to
            this reason it is considered as a complete food for eating. Rice flour is rich in starch and is used for
            making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt.
            Likewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce porcelain, glass and pottery. Rice is
            also used in manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.The variability of composition and
            characteristics of rice is really broad and depends on variety and environmental conditions under which the
            crop is grown. In husked rice, protein content ranges in between 7per cent to 12per cent. The use of
            nitrogen fertilizers increases the percentage content of some amino acids
        </p>


        <h1> MEDICINAL VALUES</h1>
        <p id="first">
            The immense diversity of rice germplasm is a rich source for many rice based products and is also used for
            treating many health related maladies such as indigestion, diabetes, arthritis, paralysis, epilepsy and give
            strength to pregnant and lactating mothers. Ancient Ayurvedic literature testify the medicinal and curative
            properties of different types of rice grown in India. Medicinal rice varieties like Kanthi Banko
            (Chhattisgarh), Meher, Saraiphul & Danwar (Orissa), Atikaya & Kari Bhatta (Karnataka), are very common in
            India. Few varieties cultivated in restricted pockets of Kerala for their medical properties e.g. Chennellu,
            Kunjinellu, Erumakkari & Karuthachembavu etc..
        </p>


        <h1>CROP PRODUCTION PRATICES</h1>
        <p id="first">
            In India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands. The method of
            cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of land, type of
            soils, irrigation facilities, availability of labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of
            rice is grown with the following methods
            Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation
            Broadcasting the seedSowing the seed behind the plough or drillingWet or lowland cultivation
            Transplanting in puddled fields.Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields
        </p>


        <h1> SELECTION OF SEEDS</h1>
        <p id="first">
            The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield. Therefore,
            proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in raising the
            healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following
            requirements
            The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.The seed should be clean and
            free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.The
            seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.The seed should have a high germinating
            capacity.Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born
            fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings
